# Inpsyde Boilerplate

This tool is based on top of [`brightnucleus/boilerplate`](https://github.com/brightnucleus/boilerplate). It's goal is to simplify and speed up the process of creating new packages for the daily WordPress work. It's focused on creating composer packages of type `wordpress-plugin`, `wordpress-theme`, `library` and `project` with the default directory structure and meta files (`phpunit.xml.dist`, `composer.json` and so on) but without any code. The created structure follows the Inpsyde Codex.

## Usage

All you need is at least PHP 5.6 and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. 

```
$ composer create-project inpsyde/boilerplate <DIRECTORY>
```

After composer has fetched some dependencies, you will get asked some question about the new package:

```

Finally the boilerplate runs some scripts to create all the files according to your inputs. At the end the sources and VCS files of the boilerplate gets deleted and a new git repository is initialized.

After that, your directory looks like this:

```
$ ls -al <DIRECTORY>
drwxrwxr-x  8 david david   320 Jun 12 17:33 ./
drwxrwxrwt 18 root  root   2440 Jun 12 17:33 ../

drwxrwxr-x  2 david david    60 Jun 12 17:33 w-org-assets/
```

The structure of the directory depends on the type of package you choose. For example the `w-org-assets/` directory won't appear for `library` or `project` types.
